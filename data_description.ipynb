    "The Global Fishing Watch (GFW) provides an open platform to access Automatic Identification System (AIS) data from commercial fishing activities. The AIS is a tracking system that uses transceivers on ships to broadcast vessel information such as unique identification, position, course, and speed. AIS is integrated into all classes of vessels as a collision avoidance tool. However, the GFW collects and processes raw AIS data related to fishing activities to improve records and assign additional information, such as the distance from shore, depth, etc. Then, with the use of machine learning models, they characterize vessels and fishing activities, which constitute some of the products available in their [API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#introduction)."

    "One of the most interesting products that the GFW API offers is estimates of fishing effort derived from AIS data. GFW uses machine learning models to classify fishing vessels and predict when they are fishing. First, they identify fishing vessels in the AIS system. Then the vessel is characterized using the best available information and their fleet registry data combined with a characterization model trained on 45,441 marine vessels (both fishing and non-fishing) matched to official fleet registries. Then, GFW estimates the vessel's fishing time and location based on its movement patterns. To do so, a fishing detection model was trained on AIS data from 503 ships and identified fishing activity with >90% accuracy. The model predicts a score for every AIS position in their database to distinguish fishing positions from non-fishing positions (i.e., navigation time). When the model identifies fishing activity, the time associated with that AIS position is registered as apparent fishing activity. More details about the model can be found on the following GitHub repository ([link](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/vessel-scoring/blob/master/notebooks/Model-Descriptions.ipynb))."

    "Once the fishing vessels are identified and their AIS positions have been assigned as fishing positions, the apparent fishing effort can be calculated for any area by summarizing the fishing hours for all fishing vessels in that area. The resulting maps of apparent fishing effort are created by rasterizing all AIS positions into a grid and calculating the total fishing activity in each grid cell. For the present project we will access this type processed data."
