    "\n",
    "The Global Fishing Watch (GFW) provides an open platform to access automatic identification system (AIS) data from commercial fishing activities. The AIS is a tracking system that uses transceivers on ships to broadcast vessel information such as unique identification, position, course, and speed. AIS is integrated into all classes of vessels as a collision avoidance tool. However, the GFW collects and processes raw AIS data related to fishing activities to improve records and assing additional information, such as the distance from shore, depth, etc. Then, with the use of machine learning models, they characterize vessels and fishing activities, which constitute some of the products available in their [API](https://globalfishingwatch.org/our-apis/documentation#introduction).\n",
    "\n",
    "Pre-processed AIS data can be accessed from their [R package \"gfwr\"](https://github.com/GlobalFishingWatch/gfwr) or downloaded from their [website](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data-download/) as .cvs files. For this project, we will use some of their existing products related to fishing effort. The data can be accessed from [Google Big Query](https://globalfishingwatch.org/data/our-data-in-bigquery/) in a less processed format and through Google Earth Engine (GEE) for two data subproducts [daily fishing hours](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GFW_GFF_V1_fishing_hours) and [daily vessel hours](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/GFW_GFF_V1_vessel_hours#image-properties). For accessibility reasons, we will focus on the GEE data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each image in the collection contains daily rasters of fishing effort measured in hours of inferred fishing activity per square kilometer. Data is available for a given flag state and day, over a 5 years period (2012-2017), with one band for the fishing activity of each of the following gear types:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Drifting longlines\n",
    "- Fixed gear\n",
    "- Other fishing\n",
    "- Purse seines\n",
    "- Squid jigger\n",
    "- Trawlers\n",

    "The data belongs to the [first global assessment of commercial fishing activity](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.aao5646), published in Science by GFW (2018). "
